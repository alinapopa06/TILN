Voluntary respondents of the questionnaire were 135 female university students of a women's university in Tokyo (Mean Age = 19.39, SD = 2.69).
One hundred one undergraduate psychology students participated in this study in return for course credit. Two data sets were incomplete because of software difficulties, so the final sample size was 99. There were 60 women, 38 men, and 1 participant who did not report his or her gender. The mean age was 19.56 years (SD = 2.43).
Participants were 169 Taiwanese senior high school athletes, including 114 boys, 51 girls, and four participants who did not identify their gender. Their age was between 15 and 18 (M = 16.43, SD = 0.7 years). The athletes recruited for this study trained more than five times a week and competed seriously. The sample consisted of 29 track and field athletes, 24 table tennis players, 23 badminton players, 18 archers, 27 baseball players, and 18 Taekwon do martial artists, 13 fencers, seven Chinese martial artists, six kendokas, one billiard player, one tenpin bowler, one swimmer, and one cyclist. These participants were mainly conversant only in the Chinese language.
Participants in this study were 72 psychotherapy outpatients from the suburban Philadelphia area. Most were seeking treatment for general distress and quality of life problems. The sample was almost equally split by gender (49% male) and age ranged from 20 to 58 years (Md = 37.5).
The study was realized in the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, University of Bucharest, for those with a Major in Psychology. A part of the specific activity of the Laboratory of personality diagnosis, implied that students in the final university year 2009-2010 complete a series of personality questionnaires. This activity was undergone so as to acquaint students with the administration and interpretation of personality questionnaires. Students were included in the research voluntarily. The method of selecting the participants in the study was opportunity sampling. Due to the high costs for collecting the assessment data for both the criterion variable and the predictor variables, we used small sized samples and avoided random sampling methods.  One of the limits of the sample distribution, specific to Psychology faculties, is the low number of male participants. The total number in the first sample was 85 participants, with an average age of 21-30 years, and a 1.87 year deviation. We must mention the fact that in the initial sample there were initially 113 participants. Information on the academic performance could not be obtained for 28 of them, and thus their inclusion in the sample was not necessary. Out of the 85 participants, 69 were female and 17 were male. This distribution is highly uneven, and thus the conclusions of the study apply.
A sample of 3,147 college freshmen were recruited at a Chinese university. Among them 3,120 students completed the questionnaires. The effective response rate was 99.14%. The participants’ ages ranged from 17 to 25 years, with an average of 19.20 years (SD= 0.708). There were 1,224 female students (39.2%) and 1,896 male students (60.8%). Prior to the study all the participants signed written informed consent. On behalf of the participants under 18 years the written informed consent from the caretakers was also obtained.
In all, 202 fulltime employees (81 males, mean age = 38.3, SD = 10.21, and 121 females, mean age = 28.4, SD = 11.17) took part in this study. They were employed in very different jobs in the retail, manufacturing and healthcare. Participants were unpaid and recruited through a group e-mail.
The participants were 156 first year undergraduate students (76 male and 80 female), who completed all measures at two time points. All participants were aged between 18 and 19 years old, and predominantly reported their ethnicity as White (78.8%), or Indian (12.8%).
Seventy-three undergraduate students (61 females and 12 males) of Maastricht University participated in the present study in return for a small financial compensation. Their mean age was 20.8 years (SD = 2.0, range 18–28 years). The main constructs in this study were assessed by asking participants to complete the following questionnaires.
Adolescents (N = 840) attending three high schools in Johannesburg were obtained through purposive sampling. The majority (435, 52%) of the participants was female, and there were 405 males. Ages ranged between 14 and 18 years with a mean of 16 years (SD = .91). With regard to population group, most participants were Black African (n = 475, 57%) followed by White (Caucasian; n = 236, 28%), Indian (n = 67, 8%), and Colored (mixed ethnicity; n = 62, 7%) participants.
This study examined the predictors of academic achievement in a sample of 131 target participants (54.2% female, 45.8% male), who were those among an original sample of 217 undergraduates with sufficiently complete data for the present analyses, as described below. Due to the “minority majority” status of the UCR campus population, the diverse sample included substantial proportions of Asians or Asian Americans (43.5%), Hispanics or Latin Americans (19.8%), Caucasians (16.0%), African Americans (12.9%), and students of other ethnic descent (7.6%). The study also includes 258 informants who described participants with whom they were acquainted. Each target participant and informant was paid $10 per hour. The larger data set was originally designed to explore issues of accuracy in personality judgment. Other analyses, completed and planned (see Letzring, Block, & Funder, 2004; Letzring, Wells, & Funder, in press; Vazire & Funder, 2006), address different topics and do not overlap with those in the current study.
Through convenience sampling method, 311 students from a state university in Turkey were recruited and willingly participated in the study. An online survey was administered using an Internet-based surveying system in a counterbalanced order. Of the sample, 236 were women (75.9%) and 75 were men (24.1%). Participants' ages ranged from 18 years old to 37 years old (M = 20.68; SD= 3.07). In terms of college status, there were 157 freshmen (50.5%), 83 sophomores (26.7%), 38 juniors (12.2%), and 33 seniors (10.6%). Almost all participants (97.7%) reported to have taken selfies, whereas 76.2% reported posting selfies on SNS.
The National Child Development Study 1958 is a large-scale longitudinal study of the 17,415 individuals who were born in Great Britain in a week in March 1958 (Ferri, Bynner, & Wadsworth, 2003). There were nine follow-ups. At age 11 years 14,134 children completed tests of cognitive ability (response=87%) and teachers provided information on 13,754 children's speech ability (response= 85%). At age 16 years, 11,628 cohort members completed a measure on leisure activities (response=83%). At 33 years, 11,142 participants provided information on their educational qualifications obtained (response= 72%) and 10,393 on optimism (response 67%). At 42 years 9592 participants provided information on their occupational levels (response= 62%). At 50 years, 8532 participants completed a questionnaire on personality traits (response=69%). The dependent variable in this study was measured at age 50 years in 2008. The analytic sample comprises 5,663 cohort members (49% females) for whom complete relevant data were collected. Bias due to attrition of the sample during childhood has been shown to be minimal (Davie, Butler, & Goldstein, 1972; Fogelman, 1976).
Participants were drawn from a University (student) population. In total, 1149 responses were returned, however due to missing data (where 1 or more questions were left unanswered) the final n = 970. Of the sample, 69.4% (n = 673) respondents were female. Ages of participants ranged from 17 to 66 years (M=22.2, SD=6.42). The majority of respondents were Irish (88.6%). Two other nationalities comprised N1% of the total sample, these were British (2%) and American (1.9%).
Participants were 213 students at a private high school in New England (112 identified as male; median age = 17). The sample included students in all secondary grade levels (9th grade: 17.1%, 10th grade: 32.7%, 11th grade: 25.1%, 12 grade: 19.4%, and college preparatory year: 5.7%). The sample was largely from middle class backgrounds (82.4% of mothers and 82% of fathers with college degrees or higher). Students self-identified as 74.4% White/Caucasian, 13.7% Asian/Asian-American, 4.3% Black/African-American, 3.8% Hispanic and 2.8% as mixed race.
One hundred fifty employees (general banking/insurance staff) from a large banking company located in South Korea were invited to participate in this survey. The survey was distributed by a graduate student well-trained in organizational research methods to each employee on-site along with a cover letter assuring that participation was completely voluntary and that responses would be kept confidential and used only for research purposes. It is noted that all measures in the survey were translated into Korean using the back-translation procedures as specified in Brislin (1980). To minimize potential common method/source bias, we collected personality and other demographic data from employees and collected job performance data from supervisors with a 1-week interval. After matching employee and supervisor ratings, complete sets of data were received from a total of 113 employees, yielding a response rate of 75.3%. Among the respondents, 60% were male and 94.7% held a junior college degree or higher. The average age was 32.8 years (SD = 5.41).
We selected specific locations such as parking lots and residential areas to recruit participants in Beijing, China. Participants were assured of anonymity and confidentiality. The data were collected by a professional research company. Initially, 448 drivers participated in this investigation. After excluding 26 non-serious participants, 422 subjects in total were assessed. Participants were asked to provide their age, sex, education, number of years after acquisition of full driving license, total/annual number of kilometers driven, and number of accidents during the last 3 years. Accidents during last 3 years were measured using the question “In the last three years of driving experience, how many times did you collide with another vehicle, pedestrian, stationary obstruction et al., including mild vehicle damage to severe casualties, whether you were the primary responsible or not.” There were 67.8% (286) male and 32.2% (136) female participants. As shown in Table 1, the distribution of age and driving experience in male and female participants were balanced, demonstrating a good representativeness of our sample.
A total of 117 available drivers (89% male) who were applicants for taxi driver positions and attending a course in Mashhad Traffic Cultural Center participated in this study. The mean age of participants was 36.59 years (SD = 9.39 years; range 24–62 years). All participants had a full driver’s license and had been driving for at least a year. Years of driving experience were between 1 and 40 years (M= 12.45, SD = 8.97). Average hours of driving per day ranged from 1 to 12 h (M= 6.30, SD= 2.93). The majority (61.1%) of participants reported no MVCs over the last year; 27.4% experienced one crash; and the re-maining participants reported 2 or more crashes over the last year. Approximately half (47.2%) of the participants reported not having been fined by police officer over the last year, 30.2% reported one fine, and the remaining participants reported 2 or more fines issued by police officers over during the last year.
Participants included in this study were 201 male security agents working for a national security company. They were recruited during a longitudinal study aimed to investigate the individual predictors of JP. The mean age of participants was 38.65 (SD = 9.89). Data were collected during specific testing sessions organized by a local section of the company, located in Rome. These sessions were offered as a free opportunity to each employee. All participants were advised through informed consent that performance evaluations would not be affected by their decision to participate. Performance data were gathered from the human resources department at the end of the year. This interval of time was deemed appropriate, given our focus on the predictive value of individual differences, which conceptually implies temporal separation between predictors and outcomes.
The participants were 721 undergraduate students from a southern university of Spain (206 males; 512 females; 3 unreported) who were told that their participation was completely voluntary and confidential and that they would receive extra credit towards their course grade. Their mean age was 21.81 years (SD= 5.27). With respect to ethnicity, all participants were White/Caucasian.
Participants in this research were undergraduate students of Technology. 254 students were asked to fill out the questionnaires. The sample consisted of 225 male and 29 female students. The range of age was 17-27 years. Mean age and SD=20.36 ± 1.61years.
The study was conducted with the support of the Human Resources(HR) department of a large German insurance company. HR sent email messages to the insurance agents. The message included the study's invitation, link to an online test, personal login code, and consent to use nine-month-later sales performance. 389 agents were contacted, 165 followed the link, and 114 finished the online test. One year later, HR provided sales performance data (29% participation rate). Of the 114 participants, 15 were female. Participant mean age was 44.6 (SD =9.3) years, having a job tenure of 12.5 years (SD= 8.2 years).
